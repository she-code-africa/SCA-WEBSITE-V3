### Fork the repository (repo)

- If you're not sure, here's how to [fork the repo](https://help.github.com/en/articles/fork-a-repo)

### Set up your local environment (optional)

If you're ready to contribute and create your PR, it will help to set up a local environment so you can see your changes.

1. Set up your development environment

If tis is your first time forking our repo, this is all you need to do for this step:

```
$ git clone git@github.com:[your_github_handle]/SCA-WEBSITE-V3.git && cd SCA-WEBSITE-V3/
Make sure you checkout the `develop` branch `git checkout develop`

If you've already forked the repo, you'll want to ensure your fork is configured and that it's up to date. This will save you the headache of potential merge conflicts.
