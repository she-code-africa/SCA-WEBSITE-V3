              everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression,
              sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size,
              age, race, or religion. We do not tolerate harassment of
              participants in any form. This code of conduct applies to all She
              Code Africa spaces, including Slack, both online and off. Anyone
              who violates this code of conduct may be sanctioned or expelled
              from these spaces at the discretion of the Community Managers.
              Some She Code Africa spaces (such as specific Slack channels) may
              have additional rules in place, which will be made clearly
              available to members. Members are responsible for knowing and
              abiding by these rules. We encourage all those who are members of
              She Code Africa to help us create safe and positive community
              experiences. Consequences for noncompliance with the Code of
              Conduct may include a discussion with mediators, mediation with
              the member you may have harmed, or as an absolute last resort, a
              ban from the community.
            </p>
            If you believe someone is violating the code of conduct, we ask that
            you report it by emailing

              You will receive an email from the She Code Africa acknowledging

              hours (and will aim for much quicker than that).

              The working group will immediately meet to review the incident and
              determine:

              <li>What happened.</li>

            <p>
              If this is determined to be an ongoing incident or a threat to
              physical safety, the working groups' immediate priority will be to
              protect everyone involved. This means we may delay an "official"
              response until we believe that the situation has ended and that
              everyone is physically safe. Once the working group has a complete
              account of the events they will make a decision as to how to
              respond. Responses may include:

            <ul className="pl-10">
              <li>Nothing (if we determine no violation occurred).</li>
              <li>
                A private reprimand from the working group to the individual(s)
                involved.
              </li>
              <li>A public reprimand.</li>
              <li>
                An imposed vacation (i.e. asking someone to "take a week off"
                from mailing lists).

              <li>
                A permanent or temporary ban from some or all SCA spaces

              <li>A request for a public or private apology.</li>
            </ul>

              We'll respond within one week to the person who filed the report
